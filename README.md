# Node.js Server Unresponsiveness
This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js applications: server unresponsiveness caused by long-running synchronous operations that block the event loop.  The `bug.js` file shows the problem, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using asynchronous techniques.

## Problem
Node.js is single-threaded.  Long-running synchronous tasks block the event loop, preventing the server from handling other requests.  This leads to unresponsive servers and poor performance.

## Solution
The solution involves using asynchronous programming techniques such as promises, async/await, or callbacks to avoid blocking the event loop. This allows the server to remain responsive even while handling long-running tasks.
